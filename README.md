This is a repository for handling JWST images from the COSMOS-Web survey (Casey et al. 2023).
For now, we have two main Python functions:
  - Download the mosaic images of COSMOS-Web from their website (get_cosmosweb_imgs.py).
  - Make cutout images of COSMOS-Web at given sky positions using the astropy package (cutout_cosmosweb.py). 

Please contact me if you have any questions or comments about my code!
