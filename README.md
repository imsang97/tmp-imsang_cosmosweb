This is a repository for handling JWST images from the COSMOS-Web survey (Casey et al. 2023).
For now, there are two main functions:

  1) Download the mosaic images of COSMOS-Web from their website.
  2) Make cutout images of the COSMOS-Web mosaic images at given sky positions.

There is also an example jupyter notebook to make, check, and save the COSMOS-Web cutout images.

  - examples/make_COSMOSWeb_cutouts.ipynb

Please contact me if you have any questions or comments about my code!
